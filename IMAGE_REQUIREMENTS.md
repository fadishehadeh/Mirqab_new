## Implementation Notes

Currently, the website uses SVG placeholder images generated by the `ImagePlaceholder` component. To replace with real images:

1. Add the image files to the `public/images/` directory
2. The website will automatically use the real images when they're available
3. Ensure image file names match exactly as specified above

## Brand Consistency

All images should align with Al Mirqab Capital's brand values:
- Trust and reliability
- Professional excellence
- Long-term vision
- Global perspective
- Cultural sensitivity

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: business-professionals.jpg (pre-footer image)
2. **Medium Priority**: Homepage card images
3. **Lower Priority**: Hero banner images (current placeholders are functional)

Replace images in this order for maximum visual impact.
